                        But, no, they just kind of hung in there for quite a number of years. They were really doing a \'hot\', creative idea but the people who found that company came out of the mini-computer business. And so, the software thoughts they had were sort of mini-computer thoughts. They kind of missed the beginning wave of the PC revolution. But it was interesting to be there. I was there on and off, almost for a total of 10 years until 1992. During that time I, actually, created my first product which was an entrepreneurial effort in its own right. I convinced a company that we ought to go into a new business. They let me run the whole thing. They let me create it and build it. And this was in the late 1980\'s. And it was the first pen-based computer that really came to the market. I didn\'t call them pen-based computers but that\'s what it was. I brought one with me. What happened to my bag? Oh, right here. I\'m not going to bring all the products I\'ve made over my lifetime. But this is the first one I designed.
