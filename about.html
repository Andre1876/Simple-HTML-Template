                        \"Hey, we like these things. This is pretty cool but can you make ones a lot smaller and more personal.\" I got this \'bug\' at that time. I started realizing; I had this sort of thought about personal computing, in general. I said, \"You know what all personal computing ought to be small. And ought to be reliable. And ought to be cheap and inexpensive. And use less power. And not require an IT staff to run and so on.\" And I\'ve came convinced and I still believe this, that the future personal computing; if you think about the world and 6 billion people on it, the future personal computing had to be something much smaller and simpler than what we had at that time. What we typically consider a personal computer today. And so I started on the path trying to accelerate that. Not that the world needed me to do that. but I said, \"Gee, maybe, I can help out and we can accelerate it and make some good products.\" And that was the genesis of Palm Computing.</p>

                        But, no, they just kind of hung in there for quite a number of years. They were really doing a \'hot\', creative idea but the people who found that company came out of the mini-computer business. And so, the software thoughts they had were sort of mini-computer thoughts. They kind of missed the beginning wave of the PC revolution. But it was interesting to be there. I was there on and off, almost for a total of 10 years until 1992. During that time I, actually, created my first product which was an entrepreneurial effort in its own right. I convinced a company that we ought to go into a new business. They let me run the whole thing. They let me create it and build it. And this was in the late 1980\'s. And it was the first pen-based computer that really came to the market. I didn\'t call them pen-based computers but that\'s what it was. I brought one with me. What happened to my bag? Oh, right here. I\'m not going to bring all the products I\'ve made over my lifetime. But this is the first one I designed.
