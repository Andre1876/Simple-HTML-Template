And so, the software thoughts they had were sort of mini-computer thoughts. They kind of missed the beginning wave of the PC revolution. But it was interesting to be there.

And it was the first pen-based computer that really came to the market. I didn\'t call them pen-based computers but that\'s what it was. </p>
